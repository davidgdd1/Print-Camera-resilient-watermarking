Abstract：In this paper, an effective print-camera (P-C) re-sistant image watermarking scheme is proposed. To achieve watermark robustness, most of existing works try to simulate P-C noise by a sophisticated math model. However, the diversity of P-C noises in the real world is ignored, and the watermarked image may not attain a good balance between high robustness and low distortion. To address the problem, we construct an efficient end-to-end network architecture for watermark embedding and extraction. To be specific, a deep noise simulation network (NSN) is designed to simulate the fusion process of real P-C noises, which can help to generate high-robust watermarked image. Also, a multitask loss function based on just-noticeable-difference (JND) is proposed to conduct constrained learning for residual image containing watermark information, thus, the distortion of generated watermarked image can be significantly reduced. Experimental results show that our scheme can achieve high robustness against P-C process while maintaining a satisfactory watermark capacity and visual quality of watermarked image.
